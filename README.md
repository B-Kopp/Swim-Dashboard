# Swim-Dashboard

I used the file USAS_scrape.py to download all of the times from 2000-2019 for women aged 15-25.

I then used Women's Data Munging & Analysis.ipynb to calcuate the change from high school swimmers to college swimmers.

Finally, I created a dashboard/calculator using dashboard/app.py
